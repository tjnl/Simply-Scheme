### 9.14

Write a procedure `substitute` that takes three arguments, two words and a sentence. It should return a version of the sentence, but with every instance of the second word replaced with the first word:

~~~ scheme
> (substitute 'maybe 'yeah '(she loves you yeah yeah yeah))
(she loves you maybe maybe maybe)
~~~

***

~~~ scheme
(define (substitute replacement-wd target-wd sent)
  (every (lambda (wd) (if (equal? wd target-wd)
                          replacement-wd
                          wd))
         sent))
