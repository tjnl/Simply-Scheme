### 9.4

The following program doesn’t work. Why not? Fix it.

~~~ scheme
(define (who sent)
  (every describe '(pete roger john keith)))
  
(define (describe person)
  (se person sent))
~~~

It’s supposed to work like this:

~~~ scheme
> (who '(sells out))
(pete sells out roger sells out john sells out keith sells out)
~~~

***

It doesn’t work because:

* the procedure `who` takes a single argument `sent` which is not referred to in the body of the procedure
* the helper procedure `describe` includes reference to a variable `sent` which is undefined.

A working version is:

~~~ scheme
(define (who sent)
  (every (lambda (person) (se person sent)) '(pete roger john keith)))
~~~
