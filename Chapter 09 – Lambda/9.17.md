### 9.17

Write `keep` in terms of `every` and `accumulate`.

***

~~~ scheme
(define (new-keep pred arg)
  (cond ((word? arg) (accumulate word (every (lambda (x) (if (pred x) x "")) arg)))
        ((sentence? arg) (se (every (lambda (x) (if (pred x) x '())) arg)))
        (else (whoops "Argument to NEW-KEEP must be a word or sentence"))))
~~~

Note:

* Because `word` takes words, not sentences, as arguments, it is necessary to use `accumulate` in case `every` returns a sentence.
* Itâ€™s not necessary to `accumulate` a sentence, as `sentence` can take either a word or a sentence as its argument.
* Using `whoops` to show an error message is taken from the definition of `keep` (see *Simply Scheme*, p.536).
