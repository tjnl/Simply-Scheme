Suppose we’re writing a program to play hangman. In this game one player has to guess a secret word chosen by the other player, one letter at a time. You’re going to write just one small part of this program: a procedure that takes as its arguments the secret word and the letters guessed so far, returning the word in which the guessing progress is displayed by inlcuding all the guessed letters along with underscores for the not-yet-guessed ones:

~~~ scheme
> (hang 'potsticker 'etaoi)
_ot_ti__e_
~~~

Hint: You’ll find it helpful to use the following procedure that determines how to display a single letter:

~~~ scheme
(define (hang-letter letter guesses)
  (if (member? letter guesses)
      letter
      '_))
~~~

***

~~~ scheme
(define (hang secret-word guesses)
  (accumulate word (every (lambda (letter) (hang-letter letter guesses)) secret-word)))
~~~
