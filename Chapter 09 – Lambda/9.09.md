### 9.9

Write a procedure `common-words` that takes two sentences as arguments and returns a sentence containing only those words that appear both in the first sentence and the second sentence.

***

~~~ scheme
(define (common-words sent-a sent-b)
  (keep (lambda (wd) (member? wd sent-b)) sent-a))
~~~

Note that this function is not commutative, with respect to a word found in both sentences that is *repeated* in one of the sentences. Compare:

~~~ scheme
> (common-words '(doe a deer a female deer) '(ray a drop of golden sun))
(a a)
~~~

and

~~~ scheme
> (common-words '(ray a drop of golden sun) '(doe a deer a female deer))
(a)
~~~
