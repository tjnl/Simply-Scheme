### 9.3

What does this procedure do?

~~~ scheme
(define (let-it-be sent)
  (accumulate (lambda (x y) y) sent))
~~~

***

The procedure returns the last word of the sentence.

~~~ scheme
> (let-it-be '(one two three))
  (accumulate (lambda (x y) y) '(one two three))
  ((lambda (x y) y) 'one (accumulate (lambda (x y) y) '(two three)))
  ((lambda (x y) y) 'one ((lambda (x y) y) 'two (accumulate (lambda (x y) y) '(three)))) ;; NB 'three is a single element so is returned verbatim
  ((lambda (x y) y) 'one ((lambda (x y) y) 'two  'three))
  ((lambda (x y) y) 'one  'three)
three
~~~

The procedure `(lambda (x y) y)` takes two arguments and returns the second, verbatim.

The procedure `accumulate` takes two arguments, a procedure and a word or sentence. It applies the procedure to the second-to-last and the last elements of the argument; then it applies the procedure to the third-to-last element and the result of the previous application, and so on, until it has worked through every element of the word or sentence from last to first. (See the description of `accumulate` in 8.3 â€“ recall that if the second argument contains only a single element, then that element is returned verbatim.)

In this case, applying the procedure to a sentence results in the last word of the sentence being returned.
