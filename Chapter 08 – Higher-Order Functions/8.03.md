### 8.3

Describe each of the following functions in English. Make sure to include a description of the domain and range of each function. Be as precise as possible; for example, “the argument must be a function of one numeric argument” is better than “the argument must be a function”.

***

~~~ scheme
(define (f a)
  (keep even? a))
~~~

The domain of the function is **non-negative integers** and **sentences containing integers**.
The range of the function is **integers** and **sentences containing integers**.

Given a non-negative integer (a “word”) as its argument, the function returns an integer (another “word”) comprising only the even numbers within the argument. Given a sentence containing integers as its argument, the function returns a sentence containing only the even numbers in the argument.

***

~~~ scheme
(define (g b)
  (every b '(blue jay way)))
~~~

The domain of the function is **selector functions** (see p.59). The range of the function is **sentences**.

Given a “selector” function as its argument, the function returns the result of the given function applied to the sentence `'(blue jay way)`.

***

~~~ scheme
(define (h c d)
  (c (c d)))
~~~
The function takes two arguments:

* the first, `c`, is a **selector function** (see p.59)
* the second, `d`, is a **word** or a **sentence**.

The range of the function is **words** and **sentences**.

Given a procedure and a word or sentence as its arguments, the procedure is applied to the word or sentence, and then applied again to the result, which is returned.
***

~~~ scheme
(define (i e)
  (/ (accumulate + e) (count e)))
~~~

The domain of the function is **integers** and **sentences containing numbers**. The range of the function is **numbers**.

Given a single integer, the function adds together each of the digits in the integer, and divides the result by the number of digits in the integer, returning the result.

Given a sentence containing one or more numbers, the function returns a number representing the average of the number(s).

***

~~~ scheme
accumulate
~~~
The function takes two arguments:

* the first is **an operator** or **a constructor function** (see p.61)
* the second is a **word** or a **sentence**.

The range of the function is **words** and **sentences**

Given a procedure and a word or sentence as its arguments, the procedure is applied to the last element of the word or sentence. In the case that the word or sentence contains more than one element, the procedure is then applied to the second-to-last element and the result of the original procedure; this process repeats until it has been applied to every element of the word or sentence, and the result is returned.

~~~ scheme
(accumulate + 147)
(+ (accumulate + 14) 7)
(+ (accumulate + 1) 4 7)
(+ 1 11)
12

(accumulate word '(ch or us))
(word (accumulate word '(ch or)) 'us)
(word (accumulate word '(ch)) 'or us)
(word 'ch 'orus)
'chorus
~~~

***
 
~~~ scheme
sqrt
~~~

The domain of the function is **non-negative numbers**.
The range of the function is **non-negative numbers**.

***

~~~ scheme
repeated
~~~

***

~~~ scheme
(repeated sqrt 3)
~~~

***

~~~ scheme
(repeated even? 2)
~~~

***

~~~ scheme
(repeated first 2)
~~~

***

~~~ scheme
(repeated (repeated bf 3) 2)
~~~
