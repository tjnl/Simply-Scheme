### 8.12

When you teach a class, people will get distracted if you say “um” too many times. Write a `count-ums` that counts the number of times “um” appears in a sentence:

~~~ scheme
> (count-ums '(today um we are going to um talk about functional um programming))
3
~~~

***

~~~ scheme
(define (count-ums sent)
  (count (keep is-um? sent)))

(define (is-um? wd)
  (equal? 'um wd))
~~~
