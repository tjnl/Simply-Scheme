### 8.8

Write an `exaggerate` procedure which exaggerates sentences:

~~~ scheme
> (exaggerate '(i ate 3 potstickers))
(i ate 6 potstickers)

> (exaggerate '(the chow fun is good here))
(the chow fun is great here)
~~~

It should double all the numbers in the sentence, and it should replace “good” with “great”, “bad” with “terrible”, and anything else you can think of.

***

~~~ scheme
(define (exaggerate sent)
  (every exaggerate-wd sent))

(define (exaggerate-wd wd)
  (cond ((number? wd) (* 2 wd))
        ((equal? wd 'good) 'great)
        ((equal? wd 'bad) 'terrible)
        (else wd)))
~~~
