### 8.10

Write a predicate `true-for-all?` that takes two arguments, a predicate procedure and a sentence. It should return `#t` if the predicate argument returns true for _every_ word in the sentence.

~~~ scheme
> (true-for-all? even? '(2 4 6 8))
#t

> (true-for-all? even? '(2 6 3 4))
#f
~~~

***

We will use `keep` to return a sentence with all words for which the predicate is true, and then either compare that sentence with the original using `equal?`:

~~~ scheme
(define (true-for-all? pred sent)
  (equal? (keep pred sent) sent))
~~~

â€¦ or, using `=`, compare the number of words in the resulting sentence with the number in the original:

~~~ scheme
(define (true-for-all? pred sent)
  (= (count (keep pred sent)) (count sent)))
~~~
