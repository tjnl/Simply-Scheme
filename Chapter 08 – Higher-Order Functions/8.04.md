### 8.4

Write a procedure `choose-beatles` that takes a predicate function as its argument and returns a sentence of just those Beatles (John, Paul, George, and Ringo) that satisfy the predicate. For example:

~~~ scheme
(define (ends-vowel? wd) (vowel? (last wd)))

(define (even-count? wd) (even? (count wd)))

> (choose-beatles ends-vowel?)
(george ringo)

> (choose-beatles even-count?)
(john paul george)

***

~~~ scheme
(define (choose-beatles pred)
  (keep pred '(john paul george ringo)))
