### 11.5

Write a procedure `initials` that takes a sentence as its argument and returns a sentence of the first letters in each of the sentenceâ€™s words:

~~~ scheme
> (initials '(if i needed someone))
(I I N S)
~~~

***

We go through the process of defining `initials0`, `initials1` and so on:

~~~ scheme
(define (initials0 sent)
  '())
  
(define (initials1 sent)
  (se (first (first sent))))
  
(define (initials2 sent)
  (se (first (first sent)) (first (first (bf sent)))))
  
(define (initials3 sent)
  (se (first (first sent)) (first (first (bf sent))) (first (first (bf (bf sent))))))
~~~

This leads us to the recursive procedure:

~~~ scheme
(define (initials sent)
  (if (empty? sent)
      '()
      (se (first (first sent)) (initials (bf sent)))))
~~~
