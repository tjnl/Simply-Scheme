### 11.7

Write a procedure `copies` that takes a number and a word as arguments and returns a sentence containing that many copies of the given word:

~~~ scheme
> (copies 8 'spam)
(SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM)
~~~

***

We go through the process of defining `copies-0`, `copies-1` and so on:

~~~ scheme
(define (copies-0 wd)
  '())

(define (copies-1 wd)
  (se wd))
  
(define (copies-2 wd)
  (se wd wd))

(define (copies-3 wd)
  (se wd wd wd))
~~~

We can define `copies-3` using `copies-2`:

~~~ scheme
(define (copies-3 wd)
  (se wd (copies-2 wd)))
~~~

If we pass the `n` in `copies-n` as an argument to `copies`, we can define the recursive procedure:

~~~ scheme
(define (copies n wd)
  (if (or (= 0 n)
          (empty? wd))  ;; we may as well check that there is something to make copies of!
      '()
      (se wd (copies (- n 1) wd))))
~~~
