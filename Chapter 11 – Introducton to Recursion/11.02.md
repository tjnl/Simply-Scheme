### 11.2 [8.12]

When you teach a class, people will get distracted if you say “um” too many times. Write a `count-ums` that counts the number of times “um” appears in a sentence:

~~~ scheme
> (count-ums '(today um we are going to um talk about functional um programming))
3
~~~

Here are some special-case `count-ums` procedures for sentences of particular lengths:

~~~ scheme
(define (count-ums0 sent)
  0)

(define (count-ums1 sent)
  (if (equal? 'um (first sent))
      1
      0))

(define (count-ums2 sent)
  (if (equal? 'um (first sent))
      (+ 1 (count-ums1 (bf sent)))
      (count-ums1 (bf sent))))

(define (count-ums3 sent)
  (if (equal? 'um (first sent))
      (+ 1 (count-ums2 (bf sent)))
      (count-ums2 (bf sent))))
~~~

Write count-ums recursively.

~~~ scheme
(define (count-ums sent)
  (if (empty? sent)
      0
      (if (equal? 'um (first sent))
          (+ 1 (count-ums (bf sent)))
          (count-ums (bf sent)))))
