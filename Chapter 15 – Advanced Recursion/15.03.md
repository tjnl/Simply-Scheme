### 15.3

Write a procedure `substrings` that takes a word as its argument. It should return a sentence containing all of the substrings of the argument. A substring is a subset whose letters come consecutively in the original word. For example, the word `bat` is a subset, but not a substring, of `brat`.

***

The substrings of `brat` are:

~~~
brat rat at t
bra  ra  a
br   r
b
~~~

From this it can be seen that two things need to happen:

* working across, recursively return the word and every `butfirst` of the word
* working downwards, recursively apply the preceding procedure to the word and every `butlast` of the word.

The two procedures are, respectively:

~~~ scheme
(define (all-butfirsts wd)
  (if (<= (count wd) 1)
      (se wd)
      (se wd (all-butfirsts (bf wd)))))

(define (substrings wd)
  (if (empty? wd)
      '()
      (se (all-butfirsts wd) (substrings (bl wd)))))
~~~
