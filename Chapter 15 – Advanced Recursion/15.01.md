### 15.1

Write a procedure `to-binary`:

~~~ scheme
> (to-binary 9)
1001

> (to-binary 23)
10111
~~~

***

To convert an integer to binary:

* divide the integer by 2
* keep the remainder (this is the right-most binary digit)
* recursively divide the quotient by 2, keeping the remainder …
* … until arriving at a quotient of zero.

Now write out the remainders in reverse order.

For example, to convert the number `23` to binary:  
\\( 23 \div 2 = 11 + 1 \\)  
\\( 11 \div 2 = 5 + 1 \\)  
\\( 5 \div 2 = 2 + 1 \\)  
\\( 2 \div 2 = 1 + 0 \\)  
\\( 1 \div 2 = 0 + 1 \\)

Therefore \\(23_{10}\\) is \\(10111_2\\).

The base-case is the number `0` or `1`, as these numbers are the same in decimal and binary.

~~~ scheme
(define (to-binary n)
  (if (<= n 1)
      n
      (word (to-binary (quotient n 2)) (remainder n 2))))
~~~

Initially I had the base case of the argument `(= n 0)` returning `0`, which resulted in an extra `0` at the beginning of the return value.
