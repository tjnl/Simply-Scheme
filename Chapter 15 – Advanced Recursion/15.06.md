### 15.6

Let’s say a gladiator kills a roach. If we want to talk about the roach, we say “the roach the gladiator killed.” But if we want to talk about the gladiator, we say “the gladiator that killed the roach.”

People are pretty good at understanding even rather long sentences as long as they’re straightforward: “This is the farmer who kept the cock that waked the priest that married the man that kissed the maiden that milked the cow that tossed the dog that worried the cat that killed the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that Jack built.” But even a short *nested* sentence is confusing: “This is the rat the cat the dog worried killed.” Which rat was that?

Write a procedure `unscramble` that takes a nested sentence as argument and returns a straightforward sentence about the same cast of characters:

~~~ scheme
> (unscramble '(this is the roach the gladiator killed))
(this is the gladiator that killed the roach)

> (unscramble '(this is the rat the cat the dog the boy the girl saw owned chased bit))
(this is the girl that saw the boy that owned the dog that chased the cat that bit the rat)
~~~

You may assume that the argument has exactly the structure of these examples, with no special cases like “that lay *in* the house” or “that *Jack* built.”

***

The structure of the input and output sentences is:

~~~ 
Input:
This is [the object] [the subject] [verbed]

Output:
This is [the subject] that [verbed] [the object]
~~~

The structure of a longer sentence reveals the pattern:

~~~
Input:
This is [the object-1] [the object-2] [the subject] [verbed-2] [verbed-1]

Output:
This is [the subject] that [verbed-2] [the object-2] that [verbed-1] [the object-1]
~~~

In essence (ignoring `this is`), the procedure:

* takes [the object] from the beginning and the [verb] from the end
* switches their order and adds the conjuction “that” between them
* tacks this on to the end of the result of recursively applying the procedure to the remainder of the sentence.

The base case is when there are only two words remaining in the sentence, which must be [the subject].

~~~ scheme
(define (unscramble sent)
  (cond ((= (count sent) 2) sent)                         ;; base case, must be [the subject]
        ((equal? (first sent) 'this) (se '(this is) (unscramble (bf (bf sent))))) ;; ignore "this is", for the purpose of recursion
        (else (se (unscramble (se (bf (bf (bl sent)))))   ;; chop off first two words [the object] and last word [verb]
                  'that                                   ;; insert [conjunction]
                  (last sent)                             ;; [verb]
                  (se (first sent) (first (bf sent))))))) ;; [the object]
~~~
