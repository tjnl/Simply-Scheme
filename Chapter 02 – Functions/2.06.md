### 2.6
List the one-argument functions in this chapter for which the type of the return value is sometimes different from the type of the argument.

***

The one-argument functions are: `butfirst`, `butlast`, `cos`, `count`, `even?`, `first`, `last`, `not`, `number-of-arguments`, `odd?`, `random`, `round`, `sqrt`, and `vowel?`.

The ones that _sometimes_ return a value of a different type to their argument are:

* `butfirst`, `butlast`, `first`, and `last` – these always return a word, but their argument can be a word (or number), or sentence.
* `count` – always returns a number (a non-negative integer), but can take a word (or number), or sentence as its argument.
* `vowel?` – always returns a boolean, but can take a word (or number), sentence, boolean(!), or function as its argument.
