### 2.7
Mathematicians sometimes use the term “operator” to mean a function of two arguments, both of the same type, that returns a result of the same type. Which of the functions you’ve seen in this chapter satisfy this definition?

***

The functions `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `and`, `max`, `or`, `quotient`, `remainder`, and `word` all take two arguments and return a result of the same type.

(N.B. Outside of the `functions.scm` environment in this chapter, only `quotient` and `remainder` actually satisfy this definition.)
