One of the functions you can use is called `appearances`. Experiment with it, and then describe fully its domain and range, and what it does. (Make sure to try lots of cases. Hint: Think about its name.)

***

The `appearances` function takes two arguments, and finds the number of times that the first argument appears in the second.

* The first argument is a word (or number).
* The second argument is a word (or number), or sentence.
* The result returned is a non-negative integer.
