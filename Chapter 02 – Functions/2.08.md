### 2.8

An operator \\(f\\) is _commutative_ if \\(f(a,b) = f(b,a)\\) for all possible arguments \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). For example, `+`is commutative, but `word` isn’t. Which of the operators from Exercise 2.7 are commutative?

***

The “operator” functions from Exercise 2.7 are: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `and`, `max`, `or`, `quotient`, `remainder`, and `word`.

Those that are commutative are: `+`, `*`, `and`, `max`, and `or`.

(N.B. Outside of the `functions.scm` environment in this chapter, `and` is not commutative, as it evaluates either to `#f` or the _last_ true argument – so if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both true, then \\(f(a,b) = b\\) but \\(f(b,a) = a\\).)
