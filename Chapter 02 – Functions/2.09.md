### 2.9

An operator \\(f\\) is _associative_ if \\(f(f(a,b),c)\\) = \\(f(a,f(b,c))\\) for all possible arguments \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). For example, `*` is associative, but not `/`. Which of the operators from Exercise 2.7 are associative?

***

The “operator” functions from Exercise 2.7 are: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `and`, `max`, `or`, `quotient`, `remainder`, and `word`.

Those that are associative are: `+`, `*`, `and`, `max`, `or`, and `word`.
