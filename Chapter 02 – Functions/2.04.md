One of the functions you can use is called `item`. Experiment with it, and then describe fully its domain and range, and what it does.

***

The `item` function returns the word at a specified location in a word or sentence. It takes two arguments:

* The first argument is a positive integer `n`.
* The second argument is a word (or number), or sentence.
* The result returned is the word at position `n` in the second argument.
