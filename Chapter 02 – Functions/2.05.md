### 2.5

List the one-argument functions in this chapter for which the type of the return value is always different from the type of the argument.

***

The one-argument functions are: `butfirst`, `butlast`, `cos`, `count`, `even?`, `first`, `last`, `not`, `number-of-arguments`, `odd?`, `random`, `round`, `sqrt`, and `vowel?`.

The only ones that _always_ return a value of a different type to their argument are the predicate functions:

* `even?`
* `number-of-arguments?`
* `odd?`

These functions return a boolean, but will not take a boolean as their argument.
