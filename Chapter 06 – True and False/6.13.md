### 6.13

Write a better `greet` procedure that understands as many different kinds of names as you can think of:

~~~ scheme
> (greet ’(john lennon))
(hello john)

> (greet ’(dr marie curie))
(hello dr curie)

> (greet ’(dr martin luther king jr))
(hello dr king)

> (greet ’(queen elizabeth))
(helo your majesty)

> (greet ’(david livingstone))
(dr livingstone I presume?)
~~~

***

~~~ scheme
(define (surname name)
  (if (member? (last name) '(jr sr))
      (last (butlast name))
      (last name)))

(define (greet name)
  (if (equal? name '(david livingstone))
      '(dr livingstone i presume?)
      (se 'hello (cond ((member? (first name) '(dr mr mrs)) (se (first name) (surname name)))
                       ((member? (first name) '(dame sir)) (se (first name) (first (butfirst name))))
                       ((member? (first name) '(king queen)) '(your majesty))
                       (else (first name))))))
~~~
