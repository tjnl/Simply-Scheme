### 6.1

What values are printed when you type these expressions to Scheme? (Figure it out in your head before you try it on the computer.)

***

~~~ scheme
(cond ((= 3 4) '(this boy))
      ((< 2 5) '(nowhere man))
      (else '(two of us)))

(nowhere man)
~~~

***

~~~ scheme
(cond (empty? 3)
      (square 7)
      (else 9))
3
~~~
The key to understanding the result above is that *everything that isn’t false is true*. (See *Simply Scheme*, p.77). Evaluating a procedure returns a true result – see for instance:

~~~ scheme
> (and empty? '(both arguments are true))
(both arguments are true)
~~~

… so in the first argument to `cond` above, the first expression `empty?` is evaluated and found to be true, and so the procedure returns the result of the second expression, `3`.

***

~~~ scheme
(define (third-person-singular verb)
  (cond ((equal? verb 'be) 'is)
        ((equal? (last verb) 'o) (word verb 'es))
        (else (word verb 's))))

> (third-person-singular 'go)
goes
