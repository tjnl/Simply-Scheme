### 6.7

Write a procedure `type-of` that takes anything as its argument and returns one of the words `word`, `sentence`, `number`, or `boolean`.

~~~ scheme
> (type-of '(getting better))
sentence

> (type-of 'revolution)
word

> (type-of (= 3 3))
boolean
~~~

(Even though numbers are words, your procedure should return `number` if its argument is a number.)

Feel free to check for more specific types, such as “positive integer”, if you are so inclined.

***

~~~ scheme
(define (type-of item)
  (cond ((boolean? item) 'boolean)
        ((number? item) (type-of-number item)) ;; note that we must check for a number first
        ((word? item) 'word)                   ;; because a number is also a word
        ((sentence? item) 'sentence)
        ((procedure? item) 'procedure)
        (else 'huh?)))

(define (type-of-number num)
 (word (if (< num 0)
           'negative-
           'non-negative-)
       (if (integer? num)
           'integer
           'number)))
