### 6.10

Write a procedure `sort2` that takes as its argument a sentence containing two numbers. It should return a sentence containing the same two numbers, but in ascending order:

~~~ scheme
> (sort2 '(5 7))
(5 7)

> (sort2 '(7 5))
(5 7)
~~~

***

~~~ scheme
(define (sort2 pair)
  (if (< (first pair) (last pair))
      pair
      (se (last pair) (first pair))))
~~~
