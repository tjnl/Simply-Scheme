### 6.6

Write a predicate `teen?` that returns true if its argument is between 13 and 19.

***

~~~ scheme
(define (teen? arg)
  (and (>= arg 13) (<= arg 19)))
~~~

Note that this meets the criteria of the exercise exactly, i.e. it would return `#f` given an argument greater than 19 but less than 20.
