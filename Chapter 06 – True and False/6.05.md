### 6.5

Write a procedure `european-time` to convert a time from American AM/PM notation into European 24-hour notation. Also write `american-time`, which does the opposite:

~~~ scheme
> (european-time '(8 am))
8

> (european-time '(4 pm))
16

> (american-time 21)
(9 pm)

> (american-time 12)
(12 pm)

> (european-time '(12 am))
24
~~~

Getting noon and midnight right is tricky.

~~~ scheme
(define (am? time)
  (equal? (bf time) '(am)))

(define (european-time time)
  (if (or
       (equal? time '(12 pm))                           ;; if it's 12pm
       (and (am? time) (not (equal? 12 (first time))))) ;; or if it's am and not 12
      (first time)                                      ;; then just return the hour
      (+ 12 (first time))))                             ;; otherwise return the hour + 12

(define (am-or-pm time)
  (if (and (> time 11) (< time 24))
      'pm
      'am))

(define (american-time time)
  (se (if (> time 12)
        (- time 12)
        time)
      (am-or-pm time)))
