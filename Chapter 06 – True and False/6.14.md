### 6.14

Write a procedure `describe-time` that takes a number of seconds as its argument and returns a more useful description of that amount of time:

~~~ scheme
> (describe-time 45)
(45 seconds)

> (describe-time 930)
(15.5 minutes)

> (describe-time 30000000000)
(9.506426344298686 centuries)
~~~
