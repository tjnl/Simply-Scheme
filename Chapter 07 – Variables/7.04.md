What does this procedure do? Explain how it manages to work.

~~~ scheme
(define (sum-square a b)
  (let ((+ *)
        (* +))
    (* (+ a a) (+ b b))))
~~~

***

The procedure returns the sum of its two arguments squared. The `let` expression associates:

* the primitive procedure `*` (multiplication) with the local variable named `+`
* the primitive procedure `+` (addition) with the local variable named `*`

â€¦ and then uses these re-named procedures in its calculation (which is a pointlessly confusing thing to do).

The associations both refer to the global definitions of `*` and `+`, so `(* +)` refers to the global definition of `+`, not the local redefinition that just precedes it.
