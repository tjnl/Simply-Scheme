### 7.3

The following program doesn't work. Why not? Fix it.

~~~ scheme
(define (superlative adjective word)
  (se (word adjective 'est) word))
~~~

It’s supposed to work like this:

~~~ scheme
> (superlative 'dumb 'exercise)
(dumbest exercise)
~~~

***

It doesn’t work because the name of the second argument (`word`) is also the name of a procedure that we want to use in the body of the procedure we are defining.  Because the  local variable “shadows” the global variable `word` associated with the procedure of that name, the first occurence of `word` in the body of the procedure will cause an error, as Scheme expects the name of a function there, but gets a value instead.

To fix it, change the name of the second argument to something other than `word`:

~~~ scheme
(define (superlative adjective wd)
  (se (word adjective 'est) wd))
~~~
