### 10.2

The program also doesn’t notice when the game has ended in a tie, that is, when all nine squares are already filled. What happens now if you ask it to move in this situation?

Write a procedure `tie-game?` that returns `#t` in this case.

***

In the case that all nine squares are filled, `ttt` returns an error. After the first four `cond` clauses of `ttt-choose` return `#f`, `best-free-square` works its way though the list of 9 possible squares using `first-choice`. The `keep` procedure in `first-choice` returns an empty sentence to its `first` procedure, which throws an error.

A `tie-game` procedure could simply check that there are no occurrences of `'_` (i.e. empty squares) in the argument `position`:

~~~ scheme
(define (tie-game? position)
  (empty? (keep (lambda (x) (equal? '_ x)) position)))
~~~

… or, more efficiently:

~~~ scheme
(define (tie-game? position)
  (not (member? '_ position)))
~~~
