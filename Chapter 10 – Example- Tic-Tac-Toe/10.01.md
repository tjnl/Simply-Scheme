### 10.1

The `ttt` procedure assumes that nobody has won the game yet. What happens if you invoke `ttt` with a board position in which some player has already won? Try to figure it out by looking through the program before you run it.

A complete tic-tac-toe program would need to stop when one of the two players wins. Write a predicate `already-won?` that takes a board position and a letter (`x` or `o`) as its arguments and returns `#t` if that player has already won.

***

If one player has already won when `ttt`is invoked, then (assuming that there are still empty squares available on the board) the procedure will still return the “best” available board position for the specified player.

To create the predicate `already-won?`, we first define a predicate `i-won?`, which returns `#t` if there are 3 of “me” in a triple.

Then we define `already-won?`:

* apply `keep` to the list of triples, testing each with `i-won?`
* if the list returned is not empty, then “me” has won.

~~~ scheme
(define (i-won? triple me)
    (= (appearances me triple) 3))
    
(define (already-won? position me)
    (not (empty? (keep (lambda (triple) (i-won? triple me)) (find-triples position)))))
~~~

More efficiently, we could check whether the word made up of 3 “me”s is a member of the sentence of triples:

~~~ scheme
(define (already-won? position me)
  (member? (word me me me) (find-triples position)))
~~~
