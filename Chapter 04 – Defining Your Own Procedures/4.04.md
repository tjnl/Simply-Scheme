### 4.4

Each of the following procedure definitions has an error of some kind. Say what’s wrong and why, and fix it.

***

The definition …

~~~ scheme
(define (sphere-volume r)
  (* (/ 4 3) 3.141592654)
  (* r r r))
~~~
… won’t work because there are two subexpressions in the body, and there should only be one. (There should be no closing bracket after π.) It should instead be…

~~~ scheme
(define (sphere-volume r)
  (* (/ 4 3) 3.141592654 
  (* r r r)))
~~~ 

***

The definition …

~~~ scheme
(define (next x)
  (x + 1))
~~~
… won’t work because the subexpression in the body is incorrectly formed – the operator `+`must precede the arguments. It should instead be:

~~~ scheme
(define (next x)
  (+ x 1))
~~~

***

The definition …

~~~ scheme
(define (square)
  (* x x))
~~~
… won’t work because the function takes no arguments, and so the `x` refered to in the body is an undefined parameter. It should instead be:

~~~ scheme
(define (square x)
  (* x x))
~~~

***

The definition …

~~~ scheme
(define (triangle-area triangle)
  (* 0.5 base height))
~~~
… won’t work because the argument `triangle` is not referred to in the body, which includes reference to the undefined formal parameters `base` and `height`. It should instead be:

~~~ scheme
(define (triangle-area base height)
  (* 0.5 base height))
~~~

***

The definition …

~~~ scheme
(define (sum-of-squares (square x) (square y))
  (+ (square x) (square y)))
~~~
…won’t work because the arguments `(square x)` and `(square y)` are themselves procedures, whereas they must be names. It should instead be:

~~~ scheme
(define (sum-of-squares x y)
  (+ (square x) (square y)))
~~~
