### 4.8

“Scientific notation” is a way to represent very small or very large numbers by combining a medium-sized number with a power of 10. For example, \\(5\times10^7\\) represents the number \\(50000000\\), while \\(3.26\times10^{-9}\\) represents \\(0.00000000326\\) in scientific notation. Write a procedure `scientific` that takes two arguments, a number and an exponent of 10, and returns the corresponding value:

~~~ scheme
> (scientific 7 3)
7000

> (scientific 42 -5)
0.00042
~~~

Some versions of Scheme represent fractions in \\(a/b\\) form, and some use scientific notation, so you might see `21/5000` or `4.2E-4` as the result of the last example instead of `0.00042`, but these are the same value.
