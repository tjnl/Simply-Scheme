### 4.10

Define a procedure to compute the tip you should leave at a restaurant. It should take the totla bill as its argument and return the amount of the tip. It should tip by 15%, but it should know to round up so that the total amount of money you leave (tip plus original bill) is a whole number of dollars. (Use the `ceiling` procedure to round up.)
