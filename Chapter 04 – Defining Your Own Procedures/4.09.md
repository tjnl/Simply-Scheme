### 4.9

Define a procedure `discount` that takes two arguments: an item’s initial price and a percentage discount. It should return the new price:

~~~ scheme
> (discount 10 5)
9.50

> (discount 29.90 50)
14.95
~~~

***

Either…

~~~ scheme
;; calculate the amount of the discount, then subtract it from the original price.

(define (discount price percentage)
  (- price (* price (/ percentage 100))))
~~~

…or…

~~~ scheme
;; calculate the discounted amount as a percentage of the original price.

(define (discount price percentage)
  (* price (/ (- 100 percentage) 100)))
~~~
