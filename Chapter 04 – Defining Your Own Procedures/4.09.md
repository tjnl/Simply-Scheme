### 4.9

Define a procedure `discount` that takes two arguments: an item’s initial price and a percentage discount. It should return the new price:

~~~ scheme
> (discount 10 5)
9.50

> (discount 29.90 50)
14.95
~~~

***

Either…

~~~ scheme
(define (discount price percentage)
  (- price (* price (/ percentage 100))))
~~~

…which calculates the discount amount and then subtracts it from the price, or…

~~~ scheme
(define (discount price percentage)
  (* price (/ (- 100 percentage) 100)))
~~~

…which calculates the discount as a percentage of the original price.
