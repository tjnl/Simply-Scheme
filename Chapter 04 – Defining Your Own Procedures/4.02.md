### 4.2
Given the following procedure …

~~~ scheme
(define (yawn x)
  (+ 3 (* x 2)))
~~~

… list all the little people that are involved in evaluating `(yawn (/ 8 2))`. (Give their names, their specialities, their arguments, who hires them, and what they do with their answers.)

***

The expression evaluates to:

~~~ scheme
(yawn (/ 8 2))      ;; substitute (/ 8 2) into the body of the expression
(+ 3 (* (/ 8 2) 2))
(+ 3 (*  4      2))
(+ 3  8)
11
~~~

**Four** little people are required.

Alonzo hires Yolanda to compute the expression. Yolanda hires three little people, a `/` specialist, a `*` specialist, and a `+` specialist.

* Charlotte is a `/` specialist. She receives the arguments `8` and `2` and returns the result `4` to Bernice.
* Bernice is a `*` specialist. She recieves the arguments `4` (from Charlotte) and `2` and returns the result `8` to Anna.
* Anna is a `+` specialist. She receives the arguments `3` and `8` (from Bernice) and returns the result `11` to Yolanda
* Yolanda returns the result `11` to Alonzo, who prints it.
