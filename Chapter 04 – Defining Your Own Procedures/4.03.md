### 4.3

Here are some procedure definitions. For each one, describe the function in English, show a sample invocation, and show the result of that invocation.

***

~~~  scheme
(define (f x y) (- y x))
~~~
The function takes two numbers as arguments, and subtracts the first number from the second.

Sample invocation: `(f 5 20)`  
Result: `15`
***

~~~  scheme
(define (identity x) x)
~~~
The function takes a single argument, and evaluates the value of that argument.

Sample invocation: `(identity 'hello)`  
Result: `'hello`

Sample invocation: `(identity (sqrt 49))`  
Result: `7`

***

~~~  scheme
(define (three x) 3)
~~~
The function takes a single argument; no matter what argument is supplied, it returns the number `3`.

Sample invocation: `(three '(the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog))`  
Result: `3`

***

~~~  scheme
(define (seven) 7)
~~~
The function takes no arguments, and returns the number `7`.

Sample invocation: `(seven)`  
Result: `7`

***

~~~  scheme
(define (magic n)
  (- (/ (+ (+ (* 3 n)
              13)
           (- n 1))
        4)
     3))
~~~
The function takes a single number as its argument, and evaluates to this number.

Sample invocation: `(magic 27)`  
Result: `27`
