Trace the `explode` procedure from page 183 and invoke

~~~ scheme 
(explode 'ape)
~~~

How many recursive calls were there? What were the arguments to each recursive call?Turn in a transcript showing the `trace` listing.

***

The `explode` procedure is:

~~~ scheme
(define (explode wd)
  (if (empty? wd)
      '()
      (se (first wd) (explode (bf wd)))))
~~~

There are 4 recursive calls to `explode`, with the arguments `ape`, `pe`, `e`, and `""`.

~~~ scheme
> (explode 'ape)

(explode ape)
|  (explode pe)
|  |  (explode e)
|  |  |  (explode "")
|  |  |  ()
|  |  (e)
|  (p e)
(a p e)
