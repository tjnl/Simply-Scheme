### 13.5

It may seem strange that there is one little person per invocation of a procedure, instead of just one little person per procedure. For certain problems, the person-per-procedure model would work fine.

Consider, for example, this invocation of `pigl`:

~~~ scheme
> (pigl 'prawn)
awnpray
~~~

Suppose there were only one `pigl` specialist in the computer, named Patricia. Alonzo hires Patricia and gives her the argument `prawn`. She sees that it doesn’t begin with a vowel, so she moves the first letter to the end, gets `rawnp`, and tries to `pigl` that. Again, it doesn’t begin with a vowel, so she moves another letter to the end and gets `awnpr`. That does begin with a vowel, so she adds an `ay`, returning `awnpray` to Alonzo.

Nevertheless, this revised little-people model doesn’t always work. Show how it fails to explain what happens in the evaluation of

~~~ scheme
(downup 'smile)
~~~

***

Referring to page 207, we hire the `downup` specialist Donna, who substitutes `smile` for `wd` in the body of `downup`. She ends up with

~~~ scheme
(se 'smile (downup 'smil) 'smile)
~~~

She needs to hire a `downup` specialist to evaluate `(downup 'smil)` before she can complete her work. She can’t hire herself – if she did, she would need to forget what she was doing.

If she *did* hiring herself and forget the previous result, eventually she would end up at the base case …

~~~ scheme
(se 's)
~~~
… and return this – but `'(s)` is not the result of `(downup 'smile)`.
