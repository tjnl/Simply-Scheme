### 13.2

How many `pigl`-specialist little people are involved in evaluating the following expression?

~~~ scheme
(pigl 'throughout)
~~~

What are their arguments and return values, and to whom does each give her result?

***

~~~ scheme
(define (pigl wd)
  (if (vowel? (first wd))
      (word wd 'ay)
      (pigl (word (bf wd) (first wd)))))
~~~

There are four `pigl`-specialists involved. 

1. Alonzo hires Patricia, the first `pigl` specialist, and gives her the argument `'throughout`. This doesn’t begin with a vowel, so she ends up with `(pigl 'hroughoutt)`. She hires Petrina to evaluate this, and retires – she isn’t required to wait around for Petrina to return a result.

2. Petrina establishes that `'hroughoutt` doesn’t begin with a vowel, so she ends up with `(pigl 'roughoutth)`. She hires Phillipa to evaluate this, and retires.

3. Phillipa finds that `'roughoutth` doesn’t begin with a vowel, so she ends up with `(pigl 'oughoutthr)`. She hires Phoebe to evaluate this, and retires.

4. Phoebe checks that `'oughoutth` *does* begin with a vowel, so she evaluates `(word 'oughoutthr 'ay)` and returns `'oughoutthray` to Alonzo.

In this case, each little person responsible for the `pigl` doesn’t need to wait on the result returned by the specialist they have hired – they may hire them and then retire. This is known as “tail recursion”, and it happens when the last thing a procedure does is to invoke itself.
