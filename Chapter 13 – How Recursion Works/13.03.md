### 13.3

Here is our first `downup` from Chapter 11. It doesn’t work because it has no base case.

~~~ scheme
(define (downup wd)
  (se wd (downup (bl wd)) wd))

> (downup 'toe)
ERROR: Invalid argument to BUTLAST: ""
~~~

Explain what goes wrong to generate that error. In particular, why does Scheme try to take the `butlast` of an empty word?

***

In terms of little people:

* Donna is hired to evaluate `(downup 'toe)`, and she ends up with `'(se 'toe (downup 'to) 'toe)`; she hires David to evaluate `(downup 'to)`
* David ends up with `(se 'to (downup 't) 'to)`; he hires Dennis to evaluate `(downup 't)`
* Dennis ends up with `(se 't (downup "") 't)`; he hires Derek to evaluate `(downup "")`
* Derek ends up with `(se "" (downup (bl "")) ""))`

Before Derek can hire another `downup` specialist himself, he (like the others before him) has to find the argument to give them. So he hires Brian, a `butlast` specialist, and gives him `""`. Brian advises that an empty word is not a valid argument – he can’t do anything with it. The entire process comes to a halt.
