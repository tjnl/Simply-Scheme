### 13.4

Here is a Scheme procedure that never finishes its job:

~~~ scheme
(define (forever n)
  (if (= n 0)
      1
      (+ 1 (forever n))))
~~~

Explain why it doesn’t give any result. (If you try to trace it, make sure you know how to make your version of Scheme stop what it’s doing and give you another prompt.)

***

If the argument to `forever` is `0`, it will return `1`. 

For any other argument, the procedure will add `1` to the result of invoking `forever` with the same argument. There is no progression towards a base case – the recursive invocation is supplied with the original argument:

~~~ scheme
> (forever 2)
  (+ 1 (+ 1 (+ 1 (+ 1 (…
~~~

The process of recursion will continue until the computer runs out of memory.
