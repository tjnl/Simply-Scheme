As part of computing `(factorial 6)`, Scheme computes `(factorial 2)` and gets the answer `2`. After Scheme gets that answer, how does it know what to do next?

***

The `factorial` procedure is:

~~~ scheme
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= 0 n)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
~~~

If we trace what happens when `(factorial 6)` is evaluated …

~~~ scheme
> (factorial 6)

(factorial 6)
|  (factorial 5)
|  |  (factorial 4)
|  |  |  (factorial 3)
|  |  |  |  (factorial 2)
|  |  |  |  |  (factorial 1)
|  |  |  |  |  |  (factorial 0)
|  |  |  |  |  |  1
|  |  |  |  |  1
|  |  |  |  2
|  |  |  6
|  |  24
|  120

~~~

… we can see that once the result of `(factorial 2)` is evaluated, the result is passed to `(factorial 3)`.

Scheme knows to do this because when a procedure is evaluated, the result is passed to the procedure that invoked it.

In the case of `(factorial 2)`, the result `2` is passed to `(factorial 3)`, which invoked it, and so it goes until the result of `(factorial 5)` is passed to `(factorial 6)`, whose result is output.
