### 14.12

Write a procedure `progressive-squares?` that takes a sentence of numbers as its argument. It should return `#t` if each number (other than the first) is the square of the number before it:

~~~ scheme
> (progressive-squares? '(3 9 81 6561))
#t

> (progressive-squares? '(25 36 49 64))
#f
~~~

Classify this problem as a pattern (`every`, `keep`, or `accumulate`), if possible, and then write the procedure recursively.

***

This procedure is a variant of the `keep` pattern. 

The base case is either:

* a sentence of less than two numbers
* the second number in the sentence is not the square of the first

… in which case the procedure returns `#f`.

If the second number in the sentence *is* the square of the first, then we can return `#t` only if there are no more numbers to check (i.e. if the sequence of numbers up to this point must all have met the success critieria) – so, we also check whether the argument sentence has exactly two elements.

Otherwise, the recursive case is the `butfirst` of the argument.

~~~ scheme
(define (progressive-squares? sent)
  (cond ((or (< (count sent) 2)
             (not (= (square (first sent)) (first (bf sent))))) #f)
        ((and (= (count sent) 2)
              (= (square (first sent)) (first (bf sent)))) #t)
        (else (progressive-squares? (bf sent)))))
~~~
