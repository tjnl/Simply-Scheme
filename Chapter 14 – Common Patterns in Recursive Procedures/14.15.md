### 14.15

Write `merge`, a procedure that takes two sentences of numbers as arguments. Each sentence must consist of numbers in increasing order. `Merge` should return a single sentence containing all of the numbers, in order. (Weâ€™ll use this in the next chapter as part of a sorting algorithm.)

~~~ scheme
> (merge '(4 7 18 40 99) '(3 6 9 12 24 36 50))
(3 4 6 7 9 12 18 24 36 40 50 99)
~~~

Classify this problem as a pattern (`every`, `keep`, or `accumulate`), if possible, and then write the procedure recursively.

***

This problem seems like it combines aspects of `keep` and `accumulate`.

Because the argument sentences are pre-sorted, the `merge` procedure only needs to compare the `first` of each; then the lesser of the two results is returned (or, arbitrarily, the other result if both are equal), and the procedure called recursively with the two argument sentences, one of them minus the result returned.

This means that the base case is that one of the arguments is an empty sentence, and then the return value is the other sentence.

~~~ scheme
(define (merge sent-a sent-b)
  (cond ((or (empty? sent-a) (empty? sent-b)) (se sent-a sent-b))
        ((< (first sent-a) (first sent-b)) (se (first sent-a) (merge (bf sent-a) sent-b)))
        (else (se (first sent-b) (merge sent-a (bf sent-b))))))
