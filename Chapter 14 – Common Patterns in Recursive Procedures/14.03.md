### 14.3

Classify this problem as a pattern (`every`, `keep`, or `accumulate`), if possible, and then write the procedure recursively.

~~~ scheme
> (remdup '(ob la di ob la da))   ;; remove duplicates
(ob la di da)
~~~

It’s ok if your procedure returns `(di ob la da)` instead, as long as it removes all but one instance of each duplicated word.

***

This procedure follows the `keep` pattern.

This implementaton keeps the *last* occurrence of any repeated words:

~~~ scheme
(define (remdup sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
        ((member? (first sent) (bf sent)) (remdup (bf sent)))
        (else (se (first sent) (remdup (bf sent))))))

> (remdup 'ob la di ob la da)
(di ob la da)
~~~

If we want `remdup` to keep the *first* occurrence of any repeated words, we need a helper procedure (which also follows the `keep` pattern) to remove any subsequent instances of a word found to be repeated:

~~~ scheme
(define (remdup sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
        ((member? (first sent) (bf sent))
         (se (first sent) (remdup (drop-word (first sent) (bf sent)))))
        (else (se (first sent) (bf sent)))))

(define (drop-word wd sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
        ((equal? wd (first sent)) (drop-word wd (bf sent)))
        (else (se (first sent) (drop-word wd (bf sent))))))

> (remdup '(ob la di ob la da))
'(ob la di da)
~~~

We could simplify this using a helper procedure that takes two sentences as arguments – the part of the original sentence to be processed, and the part of the sentence that has been processed.

~~~ scheme
(define (remdup sent)
  (remdup-helper sent '()))

(define (remdup-helper in-sent out-sent)
  (cond ((empty? in-sent) out-sent)
        ((member? (last in-sent) (bl in-sent)) (remdup-helper (bl in-sent) out-sent))
        (else (remdup-helper (bl in-sent) (se (last in-sent) out-sent)))))
~~~

If `remdup-helper` finds that the last word of `in-sent` is a duplicate, it ignores it, otherwise it adds it to `out-sent`.
