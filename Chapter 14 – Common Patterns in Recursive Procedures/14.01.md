### 14.1

Classify this problem as a pattern (`every`, `keep`, or `accumulate`), if possible, and then write the procedure recursively.

~~~ scheme
> (remove-once 'morning '(good morning good morning))
(good good morning)
~~~

(Itâ€™s okay if your solution removes the other `'morning` instead, as long as it removes only one of them.)

***

This procedure follows the `keep` pattern. There is a base case, and two recursive cases:

~~~ scheme
(define (remove-once target-wd sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
        ((equal? (first sent) target-wd) (bf sent))
        (else (se (first sent) (remove-once target-wd (bf sent)))))
~~~
