### 14.10

Write the procedure `count-adjacent-duplicates` that takes a sentence as an argument and returns the number of words in the sentence that are immediately followed by the same word:

~~~ scheme
> (count-adjacent-duplicates '(y a b b a d a b b a d o o))
3

> (count-adjacent-duplicates '(yeah yeah yeah))
2
~~~

Classify this problem as a pattern (`every`, `keep`, or `accumulate`), if possible, and then write the procedure recursively.

***

This procedure follows the `keep` and `accumulate` patterns.

The base case is a sentence of only one word, or zero words, in which case the procedure returns `0`.

If the first word and the second word of the argument are duplicates, then the procedure returns `1`, adding this to the result of recursively calling the procedure with the `butfirst` of the argument.

Otherwise, the procedure returns `0`, adding this to the result of recursively calling the procedure with the `butfirst` of the argument.

~~~ scheme
(define (count-adjacent-duplicates sent)
  (cond ((<= (count sent) 1) 0)
        ((equal? (first sent) (first (bf sent))) (+ 1 (count-adjacent-duplicates (bf sent))))
        (else (+ 0 (count-adjacent-duplicates (bf sent))))))
~~~
