### 14.5 [8.7]

Write a procedure `letter-count` that takes a sentence as its argument and returns the total number of letters in the sentence:

~~~ scheme
> (letter-count '(fixing a hole))
11
~~~

Classify this problem as a pattern (`every`, `keep`, or `accumulate`), if possible, and then write the procedure recursively.

***

This procedure follows the `accumulate` pattern.

#### First attempt

I didnâ€™t look at 8.7 and had forgotten about the existence of `count`. So I implemented a (tail recursive) helper procedure `count-all-letters` instead (following the `every` pattern), along with another helper `squash-sent` (following the `accumulate` pattern) to turn the original argument sentence into a single word.

~~~ scheme
(define (letter-count sent)
  (count-all-letters (squash-sent sent) 0))

(define (squash-sent sent)
  (if (empty? sent)
      ""
      (word (first sent) (squash-sent (bf sent)))))

(define (count-all-letters in-sent counter)
  (if (empty? in-sent)
      counter
      (count-all-letters (bf in-sent) (+ 1 counter))))
~~~

#### Second attempt

~~~ scheme
(define (letter-count sent)
  (if (empty? sent)
      0
      (+ (count (first sent)) (letter-count (bf sent)))))
