### 14.8

Write `expand`, which takes a sentence as its argument. It returns a sentence similar to the argument, except that if a number appears in the argument, then the return value contains that many copies of the following word:

~~~ scheme
> (expand '(4 calling birds 3 french hens))
(calling calling calling calling birds french french french hens)

> (expand '(the 7 samurai))
(the samurai samurai samurai samurai samurai samurai samurai)
~~~

Classify this problem as a pattern (`every`, `keep`, or `accumulate`), if possible, and then write the procedure recursively.

***

This problem is closest to `keep`, in that when the `first` of the argument matches a predicate, some action is taken.

The base case is a sentence of 0 or 1 words, in which case the argument is returned; this means that in the case that the last word of a sentence is a number, it’s included as the last word of the resulting sentence. Alternatively, if we wanted a final number to be ignored, the return value of the base case could be `'()`.


~~~ scheme
(define (expand sent)
  (cond ((<= (count sent) 1) sent) ;; returns a number if it’s the last word of a sentence
        ((number? (first sent)) 
          (se (repeat-wd (first sent) (first (bf sent))) (expand (bf (bf sent)))))
        (else (se (first sent) (expand (bf sent))))))

(define (repeat-wd n wd)
  (if (= 0 n)
      '()
      (se wd (repeat-wd (- n 1) wd))))
