### 14.11

Write the procedure `remove-adjacent-duplicates` that takes a sentence as argument and returns the same sentence but with any word thatâ€™s immediately followed by the same word removed:

~~~ scheme
> (remove-adjacent-duplicates '(y a b b a d a b b a d o o))
(y a b a d a b a d o)

> (remove-adjacent-duplicates '(yeah yeah yeah))
(yeah)
~~~

Classify this problem as a pattern (`every`, `keep`, or `accumulate`), if possible, and then write the procedure recursively.

***

This procedure follows the `keep` pattern.

The base case is an argument sentence of only one word, or zero words, in which case the return value is the original argument.

If the first and second words of the argument are duplicates, the procedure is called recursively with a new argument comprising a sentence of the first word and the remainder of the original argument apart from the second word.

Otherwise, the procedure returns a sentence comprising the first word followed by the result of calling the procedure recursively on the `butfirst` of the argument.

~~~ scheme
(define (remove-adjacent-duplicates sent)
  (cond ((<= (count sent) 1) sent)
        ((equal? (first sent) (first (bf sent))) (remove-adjacent-duplicates (se (first sent) (bf (bf sent)))))
        (else (se (first sent) (remove-adjacent-duplicates (bf sent))))))
