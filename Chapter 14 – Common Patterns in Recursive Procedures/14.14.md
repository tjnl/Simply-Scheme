### 14.14

Write a predicate `same-shape?` that takes two sentences as arguments. It should return `#t` if two conditions are met: The two sentences must have the same number of words, and each word of the first sentence must have the same number of letters as the word in the corresponding position in the second sentence.

~~~ scheme
> (same-shape? '(the fool on the hill) '(you like me too much))
#t

> (same-shape? '(the fool on the hill) '(and your bird can sing))
#f
~~~

Classify this problem as a pattern (`every`, `keep`, or `accumulate`), if possible, and then write the procedure recursively.

***

The procedure is similar to the `keep` pattern, although it is more like the `sent-before?` procedure on pp.226–227.

#### First attempt

The base cases are:

* both sentences are empty, in which case the result is `#t`
* one of the two sentences is empty, or the `count` of the first word in each sentence is not equivalent, in which case the result is `#f`

Otherwise, the procedure is recursively called with the `butfirst` of each argument sentence.

~~~ scheme
(define (same-shape? sent-a sent-b)
  (cond ((and (empty? sent-a) (empty? sent-b)) #t)
        ((or (and (empty? sent-a) (not (empty? sent-b)))
             (and (empty? sent-b) (not (empty? sent-a)))
             (not (= (count (first sent-a)) (count (first sent-b))))) #f)
        (else (same-shape? (bf sent-a) (bf sent-b)))))
~~~

#### Second attempt

Alternatively, instead of checking if the first sentence is empty and the second is not, and then vice versa, the procedure could check that the `count` of both sentences is not equivalent. I’m not sure if this is more efficient, but it’s easier to read.

~~~ scheme
(define (same-shape? sent-a sent-b)
  (cond ((and (empty? sent-a) (empty? sent-b)) #t)
        ((or (not (= (count sent-a) (count sent-b)))
             (not (= (count (first sent-a)) (count (first sent-b))))) #f)
        (else (same-shape? (bf sent-a) (bf sent-b)))))
~~~
