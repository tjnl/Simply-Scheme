###  14.9

Write a procedure called `location` that takes two arguments, a word and a sentence. It should return a number indicating where in the sentence that word can be found. If the word isnâ€™t in the sentence, return `#f`. If the word appears more than once, return the location of the first appearance.

Classify this problem as a pattern (`every`, `keep`, or `accumulate`), if possible, and then write the procedure recursively.

***

#### First attempt

This procedure follows the `keep` pattern.

We will use a helper procedure to keep count of the location in the sentence.

~~~ scheme
(define (location wd sent)
  (location-helper wd sent 1))

(define (location-helper wd sent counter)
  (cond ((empty? sent) #f)
        ((equal? wd (first sent)) counter)
        (else (location-helper wd (bf sent) (+ 1 counter)))))
~~~

#### Second attempt

In fact, this problem is a combination of the `keep` and `accumulate` patterns.

It turns out that using the `location-helper` is unnecessary, if we make the second base case return `1`, we can start adding to it in the recursive case.

We can also speed things up by using `member?` in the first base case to immediately return `#f` if `wd` is not found in the argument. 

~~~ scheme
(define (location wd sent)
  (cond ((or (empty? sent) (not (member? wd sent))) #f)
        ((equal? wd (first sent)) 1)
        (else (+ 1 (location wd (bf sent))))))
