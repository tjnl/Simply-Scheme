###  14.7

Write `differences`, which takes a sentence of numbers as its argument and returns a sentence containing the differences between adjacent elements. (The length of the returned sentence is one less than that of the argument.)

~~~ scheme
> (differences '(4 23 9 87 6 12))
(19 -14 78 -81 6)
~~~

Classify this problem as a pattern (`every`, `keep`, or `accumulate`), if possible, and then write the procedure recursively.

***

This procedure follows the `every` pattern, as it deals with each element of the argument.

~~~ scheme
(define (differences sent)
  (if (= 1 (count sent))
      '()
      (se (- (first (bf sent)) (first sent)) (differences (bf sent))))
~~~
