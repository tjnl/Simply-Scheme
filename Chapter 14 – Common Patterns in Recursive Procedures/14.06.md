### 14.6

Write `member?`.

Classify this problem as a pattern (`every`, `keep`, or `accumulate`), if possible, and then write the procedure recursively.

***

This procedure is a mixture of the `keep` pattern and the `every` pattern. It works its way through each element of its second argument (like `every`), but stops if the first argument is `equal?` to the second (sort of like `keep`), to return `#t`.

The base cases are:

* the first argument matches the `first` of the current second argument (returning `#t`)
* the second argument is empty (returning `#f`).

~~~ scheme
(define (member? element set)
  (cond ((empty? set) #f)
        ((equal? element (first set)) #t)
        (else (member? element (butfirst set)))))
