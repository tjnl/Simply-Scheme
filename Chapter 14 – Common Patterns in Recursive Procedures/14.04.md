### 14.4

Classify this problem as a pattern (`every`, `keep`, or `accumulate`), if possible, and then write the procedure recursively.

~~~ scheme
> (odds '(i lost my little girl))
(i my girl)
~~~

***

This procedure follows the `every` pattern.

The base case is “a sentence of 0 or 1 words”, in which case the return value is the argument.

~~~ scheme
(define (odds sent)
  (if (<= (count sent) 1)
      sent
      (se (first sent) (odds (bf (bf sent))))))
~~~
