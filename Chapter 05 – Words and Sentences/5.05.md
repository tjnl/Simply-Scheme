Explain the difference between `(word 'a 'b 'c)` and `(se 'a 'b 'c)`.

***

The procedure `word` takes a number of words, and from them constructs another **word** (in this case, the word `abc`).

The procedure `se` takes a number of words, and from them constructs a **sentence** (in this case the sentence `(a b c)`).
