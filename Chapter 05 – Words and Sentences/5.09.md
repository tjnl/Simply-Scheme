### 5.9

Figure out what values each of the following will return _before_ you try them on the computer:

~~~ scheme
(se (word (bl (bl (first '(make a))))
          (bf (bf (last '(baseball mitt)))))
    (word (first 'with) (bl (bl (bl (bl 'rigidly))))
          (first 'held) (first (bf stitches))))
          
(se (word (bl (bl 'bring)) 'a (last 'clean))
    (word (bl (last '(baseball hat))) (last 'for) (bl (bl 'very))
          (last (first '(sunny days)))))
~~~

***

The first returns the sentence `(matt wright)`.

The second returns the sentence `(brian harvey)`.
