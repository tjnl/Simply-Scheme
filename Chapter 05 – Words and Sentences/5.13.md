What does `''banana` stand for?

What is `(first ''banana)` and why?

***

`''banana` is shorthand for `(quote (quote banana))`. It returns `'banana`. The key things to understand are:

1. `quote` takes exactly one argument, and returns that argument *without evaluating it*.
2. That means any subexpressions within the argument are not evaluated – but NB:
3. `(quote word)` and `'word` are synonymous, and the former will be abbreviated to the latter where possible.
4. `(quote (quote word))` returns `'word`, but `(quote (quote word1 word2))` returns `'(quote word1 word2)`, i.e in the latter expression, the second `quote` doesn't get abbreviated because it doesn’t precede a single argument.

~~~ scheme
(quote (quote banana)) ;; the subexpression (quote banana) is abbreviated (not evaluated) to 'banana 
(quote  'banana      ) ;; now the word 'banana is quoted
'banana
~~~

`(first ''banana)` is `quote`:

~~~ scheme
(first (quote (quote banana))) ;; the subexpression (quote banana) is abbreviated to 'banana 
(first (quote  'banana      )) ;; the word 'banana is quoted
(first  'banana              ) ;; the first character of the word – the "quote" mark – is returned, unabbreviated
quote
~~~
