### 5.4

Explain the difference in meaning between the two expressions `(first (square 7))` and `(first '(square 7))`.

***

In the first expression, the argument supplied to `first` is a **procedure** which returns the number `49`. This is treated as a word by `first`, which returns the word `4`.

In the second expression, the argument supplied to `first` is a **sentence** which comprises two words, and so the result returned is the first word of the sentence, `square`.
