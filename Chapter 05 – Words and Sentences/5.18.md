### 5.18

Try the following and explain the result:

~~~ scheme
(define (ends word)
  (word (first word) (last word)))
  
> (ends 'john)
~~~

***

The procedure will return an error because `word` has been specified as the name of the argument to `ends`. This means that in the body of the procedure, `word` will not refer to the familiar procedure with that name, but will instead be replaced by the value of the argument supplied to `ends`.

To illustrate:

~~~ scheme
> (ends 'john)
=>('john (first 'john) (last 'john)) ;; returns an error because the first 'john is not a procedure
~~~
