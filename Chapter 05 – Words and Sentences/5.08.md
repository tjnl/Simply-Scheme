### 5.8

Which of the following are legal Scheme sentences?

* `(here, there and everywhere)`
* `(help!)`
* `(all i've got to do)`
* `(you know my name (look up the number))`

***

Only the second, as the others use punctuation marks (comma, quote, and parentheses) that have special meanings. (See _Simply Scheme_, p.63.)
