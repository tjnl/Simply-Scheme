### 5.21

Write a procedure `query` that turns a statement into a question by swapping the first two words and adding a question mark to the last word:

~~~ scheme
> (query '(you are experienced))
(are you experienced?)

> (query '(i should have known better))
(should I have known better?)
~~~

***

~~~ scheme
(define (query statement)
  (se (first (butfirst statement)) 
      (first statement)
      (butlast (butfirst (butfirst statement)))
      (word (last statement) '?)))
~~~
