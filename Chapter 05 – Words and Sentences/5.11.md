### 5.11

What kinds of argument can you give `last` so that it returns a word? A sentence?

***

Given a word or a sentence, `last` returns a word.

The only circumstance in which `last` returns a sentence is if the sentence is “improperly” formed, e.g. `(last '(you know my name (look up the number)))`
