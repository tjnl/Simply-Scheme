Write a procedure `two-first` that takes two words as arguments, returning a two-letter word containing the first letters of the two arguments.

~~~ scheme
> (two-first 'brian 'epstein)
be
~~~

***

~~~ scheme
(define (two-first wd1 wd2)
  (word (first wd1) (first wd2)))
~~~

Now write a procedure `two-first-sent` that takes a two-word sentence as argument, returning a two-letter word containing the first letters of the two words.

~~~ scheme
> (two-first-sent '(brian epstein))
be
~~~

***

~~~ scheme
(define (two-first-sent sent)
  (word (first (first sent)) (first (last sent))))
