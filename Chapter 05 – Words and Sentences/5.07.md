### 5.7

Explain the difference between `(bf 'x)` and `(butfirst '(x))`.

***

The two procedures have different names but perform the same function on their argument. The arguments themselves are different.

* `(bf 'x)` is applied to a one-letter word, and returns an empty word `""`
* `(butfirst '(x))` is applied to a one-word sentence, and returns an empty sentence `'()`.
