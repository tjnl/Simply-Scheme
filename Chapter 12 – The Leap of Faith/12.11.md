### 12.11

Write the procedure `count`, which returns the number of words in a sentence or the number of letters in a word.

***

This is similar to the `addup` procedure in 12.1.

We donâ€™t have to worry whether the argument is a word or sentence; we only have to check, for the base case, whether it is the empty word or sentence.

(define (count arg)
  (if (empty? arg)
      0
      (+ 1 (count (bf arg)))))
