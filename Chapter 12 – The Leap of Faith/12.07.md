### 12.7

Write a procedure `spell-number` that spells out the digits of a number:

~~~ scheme
> (spell-number 1971)
(one nine seven one)
~~~

Use this helper procedure:

~~~ scheme
(define (spell-digit digit)
  (item (+ 1 digit)
	'(zero one two three four five six seven eight nine)))
~~~

***

The domain of the function is numbers, and the range is sentences.

The base case is the empty word `""`.

~~~ scheme
(define (spell-number num)
  (if (empty? num)
      '()
      (se (spell-digit (first num)) (spell-number (bf num)))))
~~~
