### 12.8

Write a procedure `numbers` that takes a sentence as its argument and returns another sentence containing only the numbers in the argument:

~~~ scheme
> (numbers '(76 trombones and 110 cornets))
(76 110)
~~~

***

We define a conditional procedure:

* If the argument sentence is empty (the base case), then we return an empty sentence.
* If the first word of the sentence is a number, we return a sentence containing this number and then recursively add the result of the procedure applied to the `butfirst` of the argument.
* Otherwise, if the first word of the sentence is *not* a number, we forget about it and recursively apply the procedure to the remainder of the argument.

~~~ scheme
(define (numbers sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
        ((number? (first sent)) (se (first sent) (numbers (bf sent))))
        (else (numbers (bf sent)))))
~~~

And, we begin to suspect that the procedure `keep` must be implemented along the lines of this procedure.
