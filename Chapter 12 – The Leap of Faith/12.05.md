### 12.5 [8.8]

Write an `exaggerate` procedure which exaggerates sentences:

~~~ scheme
> (exaggerate '(i ate 3 potstickers))
(i ate 6 potstickers)

> (exaggerate '(the chow fun is good here))
(the chow fun is great here)
~~~

It should double all the numbers in the sentence, and it should replace “good” with “great,” “bad” with “terrible,” and anything else you can think of.

***

We reuse the helper procedure `exaggerate-wd`:

~~~ scheme
(define (exaggerate-wd wd)
  (cond ((number? wd) (* 2 wd))
        ((equal? wd 'good) 'great)
        ((equal? wd 'bad) 'terrible)
        (else wd)))
~~~

Then we simply apply this helper procedure to every word in the argument sentence:

~~~ scheme
(define (exaggerate sent)
  (if (empty? sent)
      '()
      (se (exaggerate-wd (first sent)) (exaggerate (bf sent)))))
~~~

NB Compared to the version of `exaggerate` in 8.8 which used `every` …

~~~ scheme
(define (exaggerate sent)
  (every exaggerate-wd sent))
~~~

… we can begin to suspect that `every` must be implemented along the same lines as our new recursive procedure.
