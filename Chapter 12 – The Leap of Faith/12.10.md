### 12.10

Write a procedure `remove` that takes a word and a sentence as arguments and returns the same sentence, but with all copies of the given word removed:

~~~ scheme
> (remove 'the '(the song love of the loved by the beatles))
(song love of loved by beatles)
~~~

***

This is similar to the `real-words` procedure in 12.9, the difference being that the decision whether to keep or discard the `first` word of the argument sentence is reversed.

~~~ scheme
(define (remove wd sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
        ((equal? wd (first sent)) (remove wd (bf sent)))
        (else (se (first sent) (remove wd (bf sent))))))
~~~
