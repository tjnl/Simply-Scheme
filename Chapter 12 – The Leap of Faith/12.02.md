### 12.2

Fix the bug in the following definition:

~~~ scheme
(define (acronym sent)                       ;; wrong
  (if (= (count sent) 1)
      (first sent)
      (word (first (first sent))
	    (acronym (bf sent)))))
~~~

***

The value returned by the base case is the first word of the (one-word) argument sentence, instead of its first letter.

We can reduce the base case to an empty word anyway.

~~~ scheme
(define (acronym sent)
  (if (empty? sent)
      ""
      (word (first (first sent)) (acronym (bf sent)))))     
~~~
