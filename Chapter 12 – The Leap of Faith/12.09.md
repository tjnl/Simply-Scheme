### 12.9

Write a procedure `real-words` that takes a sentence as argument and returns all the “real” words of the sentence, using the same rule as the `real-word?` procedure from Chapter 1.

***

In Chapter 1, `real-word?` is defined as follows:

~~~ scheme
(define (real-word? wd)
  (not (member? wd '(a the an in of and for to with))))
~~~

We use this helper procedure in a conditional procedure:

~~~ scheme
(define (real-words sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
        ((real-word? (first sent)) (se (first sent) (real-words (bf sent))))
        (else (real-words (bf sent)))))
~~~
